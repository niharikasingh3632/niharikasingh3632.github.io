<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! I broadly work in the Computer Vision and Vision–Language Models domain, with a current focus on real-time object tracking and the development of vision agents.

As an AI Engineer at [QpiAI](https://qpiai.tech/), I am part of the AI products team working on Auto ML and MLOps platform, [QpiAI PRO](https://www.qpiai-pro.tech/). My role involves translating broad requirements into technical designs and converting AI research into functional features. I build commercially viable systems, focusing on high-throughput pipelines, roadmap planning, and competitive analysis.

Before that, I graduated from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/convocation2025/StudentCorner.html) with a B.Tech in Computer Science & AI and a minor in Entrepreneurship. During my time there, I Co-founded and served as the first President of the [International Game Developer Association student chapter](https://igda.org/chapters/india-iiit-delhi/) and was a founding member of [CyFuse](https://cyfuse.iiitd.edu.in/#/home), a student club focused on AI applications. I also served on the university Sports Council. During my third year, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at the [Translational Biology Laboratory](https://dhanjal-lab.iiitd.edu.in/) under Dr. [Jaspreet Kaur Dhanjal](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/jaspreet) , where I worked on AI-based system for detecting lung disorders.

Beyond this, I spend a significant amount of my time tracking updates in AI space and AI research, exploring new research papers, and testing new model architectures. Here I post about AI news and blogs.
